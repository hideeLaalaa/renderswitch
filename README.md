# RenderSwitch React Component

## Component Description

`RenderSwitch` is a versatile and dynamic React component designed to simplify content rendering based on a specified value or condition. It serves as a flexible rendering mechanism, making it easy to switch and display different content dynamically, similar to a switch statement in React.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Content Rendering**: `RenderSwitch` accepts a `value` prop that represents the current selection or condition. It dynamically renders content based on this value.

2. **Fallback and Default**: In case the provided `value` does not match any specific cases, `RenderSwitch` gracefully falls back to default content. You can customize the default content by passing a `def` prop or use the default value, "Empty."

3. **Customizable**: Define multiple cases by passing additional props with values corresponding to possible selections. For example, you can use `case1`, `case2`, etc., as props, and `RenderSwitch` will render content associated with the matching case.

## Example Usage

```jsx
import RenderSwitch from './RenderSwitch';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <RenderSwitch
        value="case1"
        case1="This is case 1 content"
        case2="This is case 2 content"
        default="No match found"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, if `value` is "case1," the component will render "This is case 1 content." If `value` is "case2," it will render "This is case 2 content." If `value` doesn't match any case, it will fall back to "No match found."

## Use Cases

`RenderSwitch` is valuable in scenarios where you need to conditionally render different content based on a single value or condition. Common use cases include:

- Rendering different views for various user roles.
- Displaying content based on user interactions.
- Handling different states of a component.

Its simplicity and flexibility make it a valuable tool for component rendering in React applications.

## Installation

You can install `RenderSwitch` using npm:

```bash
npm install render-switch-react
```
